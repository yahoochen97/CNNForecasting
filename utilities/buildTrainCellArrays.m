%
% Obtain polling/fundemental features and election race metadata of given years/states
% Results are in the form of cell arrays. 
% input: 
%   - data: dataset that contains experience,
%           cycle,state,Candidateidentifier,Percentage_of_Vote_won_x,
%           samplesize,daysLeft,numberSupport,pollster,Republican,Democrat
%   - years: election years of to-be-collected features and metadata 
%   - states: election states of to-be-collected features and metadata
% 
% output:
%   - xs: cell array of polling/fundemental features.
%          Each element contains days before election, polling proportion and samplesize
%   - ys: cell array of pollings. Each element contains polling proportion.
%   - raceinfos: cell array of election race metadata. Each element
%   contains year, state, candidate name, actual vote share, pvi,
%   experience and party (1 if republican, -1 if democratic, 0 if third party)
